## Intro

This is a WIP mobile version of my solo project from Emerging Digital Academy, The Knitty Gritty. I wanted to challenge myself to clean up the code I had written in the original version and simplify it greatly now that I have more experience under my belt. I am writing this in React Native and TypeScript, alongside Expo for the development environment. This is a passion project that I eventually hope to upload to the Apple App Store for personal use (and maybe other people might want to use it too... where my knitters at? :eyes:)
